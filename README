pydagogue sphinx doc hosting
===========================

This branch is used to host builds of the pydagogue sphinx doc. The actual code
is in the 'master' and related branches of this repo.

How to build sphinx docs
------------------------

To make a new build:

* ``git co master`` (or similar branch)
* ``make gh-pages`` (this will do the doc build then checkout the ``gh-pages`` branch)
* If all looks good, then ``git commit -m 'Some message'``
* To push up to github, ``git push origin gh-pages`` - or, probably, just ``git push``
* ``git co master`` or similar to return to working on the text
