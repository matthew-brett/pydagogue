<div class="section" id="git-love-hate">
<h2>git - love - hate<a class="headerlink" href="#git-love-hate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve used git now for a long time.  I think it is a masterpiece of design, I
use it all day every day and I just can&#8217;t imagine what it would be like not to
use it. So, no question, I <em>love</em> git.</p>
<p>As y&#8217;all may know, <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git">Linus Torvalds wrote git from scratch</a>.  He
loves it too.  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MShbP3OpASA#t=2288">Here is Linus talking about git</a> in a question and answer
session:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Actually I&#8217;m proud of git. I want to say this. The fact that I had to
write git was accidental, but Linux, the design came from a great mind,
and that great mind was not mine. I mean you have to give credit for the
design of Linux to Kernighan and Ritchie and Thompson. I mean there&#8217;s a
reason I like Unix and I wanted to redo it. I do want to say that git is a
design that is mine and unique, and I&#8217;m proud of the fact that I can damn
well also do good design from scratch.</div></blockquote>
<p>But some people hate git.  Really <em>hate</em> it. They find it confusing and
error prone and it makes them angry.  Why are there such different views?</p>
<p>I think the reason some people hate git, is because they don&#8217;t yet understand
it.  I reason I can say this without being patronizing is because I went
through something similar myself.</p>
<p>When I first started using git, I found it uncomfortable.  I could see it was
very powerful, but I sometimes got lost and stuck and had to Google for a set
of magic commands to get me out of trouble.  I once accidentally made a huge
mess of our project&#8217;s main repository by running a command I didn&#8217;t
understand. Git often made me feel stupid.  It felt like a prototype racecar
with a badly designed dashboard that was just about to blow a tire or an
engine and take me off the road.</p>
<p>Then, one day, I read the <a class="reference external" href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html">git parable</a>.  The git parable is a little story
about a developer trying to work out how to make a version control system.  It
gradually builds up from copying whole directories of files to something very
much like git.  I didn&#8217;t understand it all right away, but as soon as I read
that page, the light-bulb went on - I got git.  I suddenly started to feel
comfortable.  I knew for sure I could work out why git worked the way it did.
I could see that it must be possible to do complicated and powerful
things, and I could work out how to do them.</p>
<p>Reading the git parable took me about 45 minutes, but those 45 minutes changed
me from an unhappy git user to someone who uses git often every day, but,
happily, knowing that I have the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>So, my experience tells me that to use git – yes <em>use</em> git – you need to
spend the short amount of time it takes to <em>understand</em> git.  You don&#8217;t
believe me, or you think that I&#8217;m a strange kind of person not like you who
probably likes writing their own operating systems. Not so - the insight I&#8217;m
describing comes up over and over.  From <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/git">understanding git conceptually</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>When I first started using Git, I read plenty of tutorials, as well as the
user manual. Though I picked up the basic usage patterns and commands, I
never felt like I grasped what was going on “under the hood,” so to speak.
Frequently this resulted in cryptic error messages, caused by my random
guessing at the right command to use at a given time. These difficulties
worsened as I began to need more advanced (and less well documented)
features.</div></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quote from the <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/book">pro git book</a> by Scott
Chacon.  The git book is a standard reference that is hosted on the main git
website.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Chapter 9: Git Internals</p>
<p>You may have skipped to this chapter from a previous chapter, or you may
have gotten here after reading the rest of the book — in either case, this
is where you’ll go over the inner workings and implementation of Git. I
found that learning this information was fundamentally important to
understanding how useful and powerful Git is, but others have argued to me
that it can be confusing and unnecessarily complex for beginners. Thus,
I’ve made this discussion the last chapter in the book so you could read
it early or later in your learning process. I leave it up to you to
decide.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So – have no truck with people who try and tell you that you can just use
git and that you don&#8217;t need the <a class="reference external" href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide">deep shit</a>. You <em>do</em> need the deep shit, but
the deep shit isn&#8217;t that deep, and it will take you an hour of your time to
get all of it.  Then I&#8217;m betting that you&#8217;ll see that the alchemist has
succeeded at last, and the shit has finally turned into gold.</p>
<p>So – please – invest an hour of your life to understand this stuff.
Concentrate, go slowly, make sure you get it. In return for an hour of your
life, you will get many happy years for which git will appear in its true
form, both beautiful and useful.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-one-thing-about-git-you-really-need-to-understand">
<h3>The one thing about git you really need to understand<a class="headerlink" href="#the-one-thing-about-git-you-really-need-to-understand" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>git is not really a &#8220;Version Control System&#8221;. It is better described
as a &#8220;Content Management System&#8221;, that turns out to be really good for
version control.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll say that again.  Git is a content management system.  To quote from the
<a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git.html">root page of the git manual</a>: &#8220;git - the
stupid content tracker&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reason that this is important is that git thinks in a very simple way
about files and directories.  You will ask git to keep snapshots of files in a
directory, and it does just this; it stores snapshots of the files, so you can
go back to them later.</p>
<p>Here is a story where we develop a very simple system for storing file
snapshots.  We soon find it starts to look just like git.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-familiar-story">
<h2>A familiar story<a class="headerlink" href="#a-familiar-story" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To understand why git does what it does, we first need to think about what a
content manager should do, and why we would want one.</p>
<p>As in the <a class="reference external" href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html">git parable</a> - we&#8217;ll try and design our own, and then see what
git has to say.</p>
<p>(To go through this a little more slowly, and with more jokes, you might also
try my  <a class="reference internal" href="foundation.html"><em>Git foundations</em></a> page).</p>
<p>While we are designing our own content management system, we will do a lot of
stuff longhand, to show how things work.  When we get to git, we will find it
does these tasks for us.</p>

<p>You are writing a breakthrough paper showing that you can entirely

<div class="section" id="make-regular-snapshots">
<h3>Make regular snapshots<a class="headerlink" href="#make-regular-snapshots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You decide to make your own content management system called
<em>fancy_snapshots</em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very simple.</p>
<p>Every time you finish doing some work on your paper, you make a snapshot
of the analysis directory.</p>
<p>The snapshot is just a copy of all the files in the directory, kept
somewhere safe.</p>
<p>You make a directory to store the snapshots called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_snapshots</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="c"># Change to nobel_prize directory</span>

<span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir .fancy_snapshots
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then you make a directory for the first backup:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir .fancy_snapshots/1
<span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir .fancy_snapshots/1/files
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And you copy the files there:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="c"># Copy all files in curent directory to backup directory</span>

<h3>Reminding yourself of what you did<a class="headerlink" href="#reminding-yourself-of-what-you-did" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For good measure, you put a file in the snapshot directory to remind you when
you did the snapshot, and who did it, and what was new for this snapshot. Call
this file <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">info.txt</span></code>.  So, we write something like this:</p>

<p>You go back and look at the original figure in

<p>You go through all the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_snapshots</span></code> directories in order, <cite>1, 2, 3, 4,

<p>You want to make two commits from your changes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>a commit containing the changes to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nobel_prize_paper.txt</span></code>, with comment
&#8220;Changes to introduction&#8221;;</li>
<li>Another commit that adds the changes to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">very_clever_analysis.py</span></code> with
comment &#8220;Crazy new analysis&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>How can I do that?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-staging-area">
<h3>The staging area<a class="headerlink" href="#the-staging-area" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You adapt the workflow. Each time you have done a commit, you copy the contents of
the commit to directory <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_snapshots/staging_area</span></code>. That will be the
default contents to be considered for your next commit.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir .fancy_snapshots/staging_area
<span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>cp .fancy_snapshots/6/files/* .fancy_snapshots/staging_area

nobel_prize_paper.txt

very_clever_analysis.py
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now, you do your edits to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nobel_prize_paper.txt</span></code>, and
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">very_clever_analysis.py</span></code> in your <em>working tree</em> (the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nobel_prize</span></code>
directory). You want to make a new commit containing the changes to the paper
but not the changes to the script.  You get ready for the next commit with:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>cp nobel_prize_paper.txt .fancy_snapshots/staging_area
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The staging area now contains all the files for the upcoming commit
(snapshot). The upcoming commit only has the changes in the paper.</p>
<p>You make the commit by making the usual directories, and copying the contents
of the staging area into the commit <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">files</span></code> directory:</p>

<h3>Now the very difficult problem<a class="headerlink" href="#now-the-very-difficult-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that the figure <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stunning_figure.png</span></code> is large.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say it changes only once across our 8 commits, at commit 5, but
we keep copying it again and again to new commits.</p>
<p>What should we do to save disk space for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_snapshots</span></code>?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cryptographic-hashes">
<h3>Cryptographic hashes<a class="headerlink" href="#cryptographic-hashes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This section describes &#8220;Crytographic hashes&#8221;. These are the key to an
excellent way to store our snapshots.  Later we will see that they are central
to the way that git works.</p>
<p>See : <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">Wikipedia on hash
functions</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>hash</em> is the result of running a <em>hash function</em> over a block of
data. The hash is a fixed length string that is the characteristic
<em>fingerprint</em> of that exact block of data.  One common hash function is called
SHA1.  Let&#8217;s run this via the command line:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="c"># Make a file with a single line of text</span>
<span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;git is a rude word in UK English&quot;</span> &gt; git_is_rude
<span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="c"># Show the SHA1 hash</span>
<span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>shasum git_is_rude
30ad6c360a692c1fe66335bb00d00e0528346be5  git_is_rude
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Not too exciting so far. However, the rather magical nature of this string is
not yet apparent. This SHA1 hash is a <em>cryptographic</em> hash because:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the hash value is (almost) unique to this exact file contents, and</li>
<li>it is (almost) impossible to find some other file contents with the same
hash.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, there is no practical way for you to find another file with
different contents that will give the same hash.</p>
<p>For example, a tiny change in the string makes the hash completely different.
Here I&#8217;ve just added a full stop at the end:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;git is a rude word in UK English.&quot;</span> &gt; git_is_rude_stop
<span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>shasum git_is_rude_stop
23d97b00299c250b43049be67c97cf2e5ffc2428  git_is_rude_stop
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So, if you give me some data, and I calculate the SHA1 hash value, and it
comes out as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">30ad6c360a692c1fe66335bb00d00e0528346be5</span></code>, then I can be very
sure that the data you gave me was exactly the ASCII string &#8220;git is a rude
word in UK English&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hashes-make-excellent-unique-file-names">
<h3>Hashes make excellent unique file names<a class="headerlink" href="#hashes-make-excellent-unique-file-names" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Remember that our problem was that many commits may have exactly the same
contents for individual files.</p>
<p>For example, maybe commits 1 through 4 have exactly the same contents for the
file <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stunning_figure.png</span></code>.  The figure changes for commit 5 but stays the
same through to commit 8.  Can we find a way to store only the two different
versions of this file, and make our commits point to one of these two
versions?</p>
<p>We can do this by storing only the two unique versions of
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stunning_figure.png</span></code> with unique filenames.  Maybe store the first version
of the file as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stunning_figure.png.v1</span></code> and the second as
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stunning_figure.png.v2</span></code>.  Then make commits 1 through 4 point to
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stunning_figure.png.v1</span></code> for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stunning_figure.png</span></code>, and make commits 5
through 8 point to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stunning_figure.png.v2</span></code>.</p>
<p>But, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stunning_figure.png.v1</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stunning_figure.png.v2</span></code> are not very
good unique filenames.  What happens if Josephine and I are working at the
same time on different copies of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nobel_prize</span></code>, and she and I both make a
new version of the figure.  My version will be called
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stunning_figure.png.v3</span></code> and her version will have the same name, but they
will be different, and this will cause a mess if we try and merge our work.</p>
<p>What if we use the file hash values as unique filenames?</p>
<p>First we make a directory to put the unique file contents:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir .fancy_snapshots/objects
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We calculate the hash for the first version of the figure:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>shasum .fancy_snapshots/1/files/stunning_figure.png
aff88ecead2c7166770969a54dc855c8b91be864  .fancy_snapshots/1/files/stunning_figure.png
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We copy the first version of the figure there using its hash as a unique
filename:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>cp .fancy_snapshots/1/files/stunning_figure.png .fancy_snapshots/objects/aff88ecead2c7166770969a54dc855c8b91be864
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We do the same thing for the second version of the figure:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>shasum .fancy_snapshots/5/files/stunning_figure.png
f86b56e97a3378f313eccadf78ab0a74ce56049f  .fancy_snapshots/5/files/stunning_figure.png
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>cp .fancy_snapshots/5/files/stunning_figure.png .fancy_snapshots/objects/f86b56e97a3378f313eccadf78ab0a74ce56049f
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We will tell commits 1 through 4 to use
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_snapshots/objects/aff88ecead2c7166770969a54dc855c8b91be864</span></code> for
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stunning_figure.png</span></code>.</p>
<p>Commits 5 though 8 will use
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_snapshots/objects/f86b56e97a3378f313eccadf78ab0a74ce56049f</span></code> for
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stunning_figure.png</span></code>.</p>
<p>Now what happens if Josephine and I make different figures and do the same
procedure of copying to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_snapshots/objects</span></code>?  If our two figures are
different, then they will have different hashes, and therefore different
filenames, so they will not clash with each other.  If the two figures happen
to be the same, then they will have the same hash, and the same filename, so
my object contents and filename will be identical to Josephine&#8217;s and there is
still no clash.</p>

<p>Now we work on the files from the second commit. These are the files in
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_snapshots/2/files</span></code>.</p>
<p>Remember that we only changed <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nobel_prize_paper.txt</span></code> in this commit.</p>
<p>Do we need to copy <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nobel_prize_papar.txt</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stunning_figure.png</span></code> to the
objects directory again?</p>
<p>No - because they have not changed.  Because they have not changed, their hash
values have not changed.  Because their hash values have not changed, and
because the hash values are unique to the contents, we already have the files
we need in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">objects</span></code> directory.</p>
<p>Specifically, because <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_snapshots/2/stunning_figure.png</span></code> is the same as
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_snapshots/1/stunning_figure.png</span></code> we know that the hash is the same,
and the hash is the one we&#8217;ve already calculated,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">aff88ecead2c7166770969a54dc855c8b91be864</span></code>.  We already have a file
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_snapshots/objects/aff88ecead2c7166770969a54dc855c8b91be864</span></code>, and we
know, because the hash values are unique, that this file must contain the
exact contents of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_snapshots/1/stunning_figure.png</span></code>, which is also the
exact contents of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_snapshots/2/stunning_figure.png</span></code>.</p>
<p>So in general, if we do a hash on a file, and then we find a filename the same
as this hash in the objects directory, we already have that exact contents
backed up, and we don&#8217;t need to do a copy.</p>

<p>The directory listing is just a text file.  We can store the directory listing
as we store the other files, by writing an object file with the file hash.
Here is the hash for the directory listing of the first commit:</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve seen that we can make a directory listing file that is unique for the
whole contents of the snapshot files (file contents and file names).
Therefore the <em>hash</em> of the directory listing file is also unique for the
contents of the snapshot files.  So, we can make a <em>commit file</em> that is the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">info.txt</span></code> file above, but now with the hash of the directory listing file
included.  Adding the hash of the directory listing file means that this
<em>commit file</em> is now also unique to the contents of the snapshot.  The commit
file for the first commit might look something like this:</p>

<p>Can we completely get rid of our snapshot directories <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_snapshots/1</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_snapshots/2</span></code>?</p>
<p>The reason for our commit names &#8220;1&#8221;, &#8220;2&#8221;, &#8220;3&#8221; was so we know that commit &#8220;2&#8221;
comes after commit &#8220;1&#8221; and before commit &#8220;3&#8221;. Now our commits have hash value
filenames, we can&#8217;t tell the order from the name.</p>
<p>However, the commit hash does uniquely identify the commit.  For example, we
know that the file beginning <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2f5e799</span></code> completely defines the first
commit:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>cat .fancy_snapshots/objects/2f5e799e614b4e80c6f5a035ac29e1d16855e409

Author: I. M. Awesome
Notes: First backup of my amazing idea
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can specify the order by adding the commit hash of the previous (parent)
commit into the current commit. For example, we can make the second commit
point back to the first commit like this:</p>
<div class="admonition">
<em class="first">Contents of </em><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_snapshots/2/info.txt</span></code><div class="last highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Tree: 4f379c649a596d2f9cc2cf5b91f4a67a3101b65e

<p>Notice that git log identies each commit with its hash.  As we saw above, the

<p>Why are the output of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">log</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">log</span> <span class="pre">--parents</span></code> the same in this

<h3>git branch - which branch are we on?<a class="headerlink" href="#git-branch-which-branch-are-we-on" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Branches are bookmarks. They associate a name (like &#8220;master&#8221;) with a commit
(such as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">90dcc3544add7ea7560f289faeaa4b8edccb257f</span></code>).</p>
<p>The default branch for git is called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>. Git creates it
automatically when we do our first commit.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git branch
* master
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Asking for more verbose detail shows us that the branch is pointing to a
particular commit (where the commit is given by a hash):</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git branch -v
* master 90dcc35 First backup of my amazing idea
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A branch is just a name that points to a commit.  In fact, git stores branches
as tiny text files, where the filename is the name of the branch, and the
contents is the hash of the commit that it points to:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>ls .git/refs/heads
master

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We will soon see that, if we are working on a branch, and we do a commit, then
git will update the branch to point to the new commit.</p>

<h3>Adding with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-a</span></code><a class="headerlink" href="#adding-with-a" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>So far we have done our commits with at least two steps: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code> and
then <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span></code>.  It also possible to add files and commit the snapshot in
one step, using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span> <span class="pre">-a</span></code>.</p>
<p>Here is an example.  We first add some text to a couple of files that we are
already tracking:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;More self congratulation&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; nobel_prize_paper.txt

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then we create another file that git knows nothing about:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;My cat Arthur for dribbling on my keyboard&quot;</span> &gt; acknowledgments.txt

  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot;</span> to discard changes in working directory<span class="o">)</span>

  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot;</span> to include in what will be committed<span class="o">)</span>

	acknowledgments.txt

no changes added to commit <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&quot;git add&quot;</span> and/or <span class="s2">&quot;git commit -a&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Git tells us, as expected, that we have two modified files that have not been
staged, and one untracked file.   You also see that git has two suggestions
for us – that we do <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code> on the modified files (as we have done up
to now) – and / or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span> <span class="pre">-a</span></code> (the subject of this section).</p>
<p>Adding the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-a</span></code> flag to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span></code> means that git will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add</span></code> any modified, tracked files to the staging area</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">commit</span></code> these modified files.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our case, it is a shortcut for:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>git add nobel_prize_paper.txt
git add an_experiment.txt
git commit
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-a</span></code> flag to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span></code> ignores any untracked files – so
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acknowledgments.txt</span></code> will still be untracked:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git commit -a -m <span class="s2">&quot;Paper ready for submission to Science&quot;</span>

</div>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git status

Untracked files:
  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot;</span> to include in what will be committed<span class="o">)</span>

	acknowledgments.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&quot;git add&quot;</span> to track<span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Maybe we aren&#8217;t ready for the acknowledgments yet, so we&#8217;ll delete that file
for now:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>rm acknowledgments.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you have used other version control systems, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-a</span></code> flag may look like
a good idea, but experienced users often find that they use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span></code> much more often than they use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span> <span class="pre">-a</span></code>.  The explicit
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code> helps us think about the changes we are adding, whereas the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-a</span></code>
flag makes it easier to add changes we didn&#8217;t intend.  So I recommend you
always use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code>, especially when you are learning, and that&#8217;s how I&#8217;m
going to do the rest of the examples in this tutorial.</p>

<span id="git-tag"></span><h3>git tag makes a static bookmark<a class="headerlink" href="#git-tag-makes-a-static-bookmark" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have seen that a branch is a bookmark that points to a commit.</p>
<p>When we do a new commit on a branch, the branch points to the new commit.</p>
<p>We can also make bookmarks that do not update when we do a commit.  These are
git <em>tags</em>.</p>
<p>Imagine we are now happy with the state of our paper, and we submit it to
Science.</p>
<p>We want to record the exact state of the paper when we sent it to Science,
because we may need to go back to this version when those nasty Science
reviewers ask us to make changes.</p>
<p>We could write down the current commit hash somewhere, but then we might lose
it.  Luckily <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">tag</span></code> has a better solution:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git tag submitted-to-science
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We now have a tag with name <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">submitted-to-science</span></code> that points to this
commit.  As we will see, unlike a branch, the tag does not change when you do
another commit.</p>
<p>The current commit is:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git branch -v
* master 13fcdb3 Paper ready <span class="k">for</span> submission to Science
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">tag</span></code> without arguments will list the current tags:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git tag
submitted-to-science
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As you can imagine, this tag is very similar to a branch – it is just a
tiny file where the name of the file is the tag name, and the contents is the
commit hash:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>ls .git/refs/tags
submitted-to-science
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>cat .git/refs/tags/submitted-to-science
13fcdb3a2960af8f17cae8eaea4e3bebac526b84
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This type of tag is what git calls a <em>lightweight</em> tag – it is just a
bookmark to a commit, with no other information.</p>
<p>We often want to add some extra information to our tags, such as a message
about what the tag is for, the date, and the person doing the tag.  We can do
this with <em>annotated tags</em>. To make an annotated tag, use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-a</span></code> flag to
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">tag</span></code> and give a tag message:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git tag -a -m <span class="s2">&quot;Submitted to Science&quot;</span> annotated-to-science
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">I&#8217;m using the the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-m</span></code> flag as I have for the commits, and for the same
reason.  Normally you would not use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-m</span></code> and let the text editor open
for you to type the tag message.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git tag
annotated-to-science
submitted-to-science
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There is still a tiny text file for the tag:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>ls .git/refs/tags
annotated-to-science
submitted-to-science
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This time the tag does not point to a commit hash, but to a new tag object:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>cat .git/refs/tags/annotated-to-science
99c5a98d00e8cfadf0de21c8b47fcf4e9fac9f48
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The new tag object is very much like a commit object, but pointing to a commit
object rather than a tree object:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git cat-file -p 99c5a98d00e8cfadf0de21c8b47fcf4e9fac9f48

<p>Remember that a branch is simply a bookmark pointing to a particular commit.</p>
<p>We can have multiple branches in a repository, where each one may point to a
different commit.</p>
<p>At the moment, we only have one branch, &#8220;master&#8221;:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git branch -v

<p>We can make a new branch with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">branch</span></code> command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git branch experiment

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The new branch, by default, points to the commit we are currently on, and this
commit is the also the commit that the &#8220;master&#8221; branch points to.  So, at the
moment &#8220;master&#8221; and &#8220;experiment&#8221; point to the same commit.</p>
<p>Of course this new branch is also just a tiny text file with the name of the
branch and the commit that it currently points to:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>ls .git/refs/heads

<p>Remember that, when you make a new commit, git moves the branch pointer to
point at the new commit.  Now we have two branches, how does git know which is
the current branch, in order to move the right branch pointer when you make a
commit?</p>
<p>This information goes in a special git pointer, called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HEAD</span></code>.  HEAD stores

<h3>Heads and refs<a class="headerlink" href="#heads-and-refs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For git, a <em>reference</em> or a <em>ref</em> is a name that refers to another object. A
reference almost invariably points to a commit object <a class="footnote-reference" href="#tag-other-objects" id="id6">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>For example a branch is a reference, and so is a tag. Remember that git stores
branches and tags in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.git/refs</span></code>.</p>
<p>A <em>head</em> is a reference to a commit that updates when we do <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span></code>.
All branches are heads.  A tag is not a head because it does not update when
we do a commit.  Remember that git stores branches in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.git/refs/heads</span></code>.
The special reference HEAD points to the current head that we are working on.</p>

<h3>Developing on different branches<a class="headerlink" href="#developing-on-different-branches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s now illustrate all of this with a concrete example. We get our bearings

<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>.</p>

<p>As we&#8217;ll see later, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span> <span class="pre">somebranch</span></code> also sets the contents
of the working tree to match the commit contents for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">somebranch</span></code>. In
this case the commits for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">experiment</span></code> are currently
the same, meaning they have the same corresponding working tree, so our
working tree did not change.</p>

<p>We do a merge when we have made some changes in one branch, and we want to
bring (merge) these changes into another branch.</p>
<p>The typical situation is where we have made some useful changes in an
experimental branch - like our <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">experiment</span></code> branch, and we decide we want to
make these changes part of the main line of development - often the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>

<div class="section" id="an-important-aside-conflict-management">
<h3>An important aside: conflict management<a class="headerlink" href="#an-important-aside-conflict-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While git is very good at merging, if two different branches modify the
same file in the same location, it simply can&#8217;t decide which change
should prevail. At that point, human intervention is necessary to make
the decision. Git will help you by marking the location in the file that
has a problem, but it&#8217;s up to you to resolve the conflict. Let&#8217;s see how
that works by intentionally creating a conflict.</p>
<p>We start by making another new branch and making a change to our experiment
file:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git branch trouble
<span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git checkout trouble
Switched to branch <span class="s1">&#39;trouble&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;This is going to be a problem...&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; an_experiment.txt
<span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git add an_experiment.txt
<span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Changes in the trouble branch&quot;</span>
<span class="o">[</span>trouble 1b042ca<span class="o">]</span> Changes in the trouble branch
 <span class="m">1</span> file changed, <span class="m">1</span> insertion<span class="o">(</span>+<span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And now we go back to the master branch, where we change the <em>same</em>
file:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git checkout master
<span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;More work on the master branch...&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; an_experiment.txt
<span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git add an_experiment.txt
<span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Mainline work&quot;</span>
<span class="o">[</span>master ec4d434<span class="o">]</span> Mainline work
 <span class="m">1</span> file changed, <span class="m">1</span> insertion<span class="o">(</span>+<span class="o">)</span>
Switched to branch <span class="s1">&#39;master&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So now let&#8217;s see what happens if we try to merge the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trouble</span></code> branch
into <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git merge trouble -m <span class="s2">&quot;Unlikely this one will work&quot;</span>
Auto-merging an_experiment.txt
CONFLICT <span class="o">(</span>content<span class="o">)</span>: Merge conflict in an_experiment.txt
Automatic merge failed<span class="p">;</span> fix conflicts and <span class="k">then</span> commit the result.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what git has put into our file:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>cat an_experiment.txt
Some crazy idea
<span class="o">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</span>&lt; HEAD
More work on the master branch...
<span class="o">=======</span>
This is going to be a problem...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trouble
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The text between <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;</span></code>... and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">==</span></code>... gives the changes added by our
current branch – <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HEAD</span></code>.  These are the changes introduced by the branch
we are merging <em>into</em>.</p>
<p>The text between <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">==</span></code>... and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;</span></code>... gives the changes added by the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trouble</span></code> branch.  These are the changes introduced by the branch we are
merging <em>from</em>.</p>
<p>At this point, we can go into the file with a text editor, decide which
changes to keep, and make a new commit that records our decision.</p>
<p>I decided that both pieces of text were useful, but I want to integrate them
with some changes.  I do the edits by writing the file I want directly:</p>
<div class="admonition">
<em class="first">Contents of </em><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">an_experiment.txt</span></code><div class="last highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Some crazy idea

This is no longer going to be a problem...
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git status

<p>Let&#8217;s say you have an external backup disk and you want to record all the

<p>To do this you need three steps:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Make an empty backup repository on the external backup disk</li>
<li>Point your current git repository at the backup repository with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">remote</span>

<h4>Make the empty backup repository<a class="headerlink" href="#make-the-empty-backup-repository" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s say your external disk is mounted at <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/Volumes/my_usb_disk</span></code>.</p>

<p>Notice the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--bare</span></code> flag.  This tells git to make a repository that does not
have a working tree, but only the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.git</span></code> repository directory:</p>

<p>This is what we want in this case, because we will not ever want to edit the

<p>Before we do the push, there are no objects in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.git/objects</span></code> directory
of the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">usb_backup</span></code> backup repository:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>tree -a /Volumes/my_usb_disk/nobel_prize.git/objects
/Volumes/my_usb_disk/nobel_prize.git/objects
├── info
└── pack

<span class="m">2</span> directories, <span class="m">0</span> files
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then we push:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git push usb_backup master
To /Volumes/my_usb_disk/nobel_prize.git
 * <span class="o">[</span>new branch<span class="o">]</span>      master -&gt; master
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This command tells git to take all the information necessary to reconstruct
the history of the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> branch, and send it to the remote repository.
Sure enough, we now have files in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.git/objects</span></code> of the backup repository:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>tree -a /Volumes/my_usb_disk/nobel_prize.git/objects

<span id="git-push"></span><h4>git push – synchronizing repositories<a class="headerlink" href="#git-push-synchronizing-repositories" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">push</span></code> is an excellent way to do backups, because it only transfers the
information that the remote repository does not have.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see that in action.</p>
<p>First we make a new commit in the local repository:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Express confidence in the study&quot;</span> &gt;&gt; nobel_prize_paper.txt

<span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Buff up the paper some more&quot;</span>
<span class="o">[</span>master 4c0d480<span class="o">]</span> Buff up the paper some more
 <span class="m">1</span> file changed, <span class="m">1</span> insertion<span class="o">(</span>+<span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Git updated the local <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> branch, but the remote does not know about
this update yet:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git branch -a -v
  experiment                ef61c8d Trying something new
* master                    4c0d480 Buff up the paper some more
  trouble                   1b042ca Changes in the trouble branch
  remotes/usb_backup/master 4a763d5 Completed merge of trouble, fixing conflicts along the way
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We already know there will be three new objects in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.git/objects</span></code> after this
commit.  These are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a new blob (file) object for the modified <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nobel_prize_paper.txt</span></code>;</li>
<li>a new tree (directory listing) object associating the new hash for the
contents of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nobel_prize_paper.txt</span></code> with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nobel_prize_paper.txt</span></code>
filename;</li>
<li>the new commit object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually we don&#8217;t need to worry about which objects these are, but here we will
track these down to show how <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">push</span></code> works.</p>
<p>The commit object we can see from the top of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">log</span></code>. The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-1</span></code> flag to
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">log</span></code> tells git to show just the most recent commit from the log:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git log -1

<p>So the commit is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">4c0d480cc1588b4f3e78f7798ee1103655b8276e</span></code>. We can get the tree object from the commit object:</p>

</div>
<p>Here are the branch positions in the work desktop repository:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git branch -a -v

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As you can see, the last known positions of the remote branches have not
changed from last night.  This reminds us that the last known positions only
get refreshed when we do an explicit git command to communicate with the
remote copy.  Git stores the &#8220;last known positions&#8221; in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">refs/remotes</span></code>.  For
example, if the remote name is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">usb_backup</span></code> and the branch is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>,
then the last known position (commit hash) is the contents of the file
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">refs/remotes/usb_backup/master</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>cat .git/refs/remotes/usb_backup/master
4c0d480cc1588b4f3e78f7798ee1103655b8276e
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The commands that update the last known positions are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">clone</span></code> (a whole new copy, copying the remote branch positions with
it);</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">push</span></code> (copies data and branch positions to the remote repository, and
updates last known positions in the local repository);</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">fetch</span></code> (this section) (copies data and last known positions from
remote repository into the local repository);</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></code> (this is just a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">fetch</span></code> followed by a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">merge</span></code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have plugged in the USB drive, we can fetch the data and last known
positions from the remote:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git fetch usb_backup

   4c0d480..3efeaec  master     -&gt; usb_backup/master
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The last known positions are now the same as those on the remote repository:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git branch -a -v

  remotes/usb_backup/master 3efeaec More great ideas after some wine
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can set our local master branch to be the same as the remote master branch
by doing a merge:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>desktop<span class="o">]</span><span class="nv">$ </span>git merge usb_backup/master

</div>
<p>This does a merge between <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">usb_backup/master</span></code> and local <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>.  In this
case, the &#8220;merge&#8221; is very straightforward, because there have been no new
changes in local <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> since the new edits we have in the remote.
Therefore the &#8220;merge&#8221; only involves setting local <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> to point to the
same commit as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">usb_backup/master</span></code>.  This is called a &#8220;fast-forward&#8221; merge,
because it just involves advancing the branch pointer, rather than fusing two
lines of development:</p>

<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></code> is just a shortcut for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">fetch</span></code> followed by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">merge</span></code>.</p>
<p>For example, instead of doing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">fetch</span> <span class="pre">usb_backup</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">merge</span>
<span class="pre">usb_backup/master</span></code> above, we could have done <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">pull</span> <span class="pre">usb_backup</span> <span class="pre">master</span></code>.
If we do that now, of course there is nothing to do:</p>

</div>
<p>When you first start using git, I strongly recommend you always use an
explicit <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">fetch</span></code> followed by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">merge</span></code> instead of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></code>.  It
is very common to run into problems using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></code> that are made more
confusing by the fusion of the &#8220;fetch&#8221; and &#8220;merge&#8221; step.  For example, it is
not uncommon that you have done more work on a local copy, before you do an
innocent <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></code> from a repository with new work on the same file.  You
may well get merge conflicts, which can be rather surprising and confusing,
even for experienced users.  If you do <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">fetch</span></code> followed by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span>
<span class="pre">merge</span></code>, the steps are clearer so the merge conflict is less confusing and it
is clearer what to do.</p>

<p>It may well be that we nearly always want to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">push</span></code> the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>

<p>Now instead of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">push</span> <span class="pre">usb_backup</span> <span class="pre">master</span></code> we can just do <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">push</span></code>.</p>
<p>Before we try this, we need to set a default configuration variable to avoid a

<p>Git also knows what to do if we do <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">fetch</span></code> from this branch.</p>
<p>To show this at work, we go home to the laptop, fetch the desktop work from

clarity, so Carl Worth decided to <a class="reference external" href="http://cworth.org/hgbook-git/tour">port</a> its introductory chapter to Git. It&#8217;s
a nicely written intro, which is possible in good measure because of how
similar the underlying models of Hg and Git ultimately are.</li>

<h3>For SVN users<a class="headerlink" href="#for-svn-users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you want a bit more background on why the model of version control
used by Git and Mercurial (known as distributed version control) is such
a good idea, I encourage you to read this very well written
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2010/03/17.html">post</a> by Joel
Spolsky on the topic. After that post, Joel created a very nice
Mercurial tutorial, whose <a class="reference external" href="http://hginit.com/00.html">first page</a>
applies equally well to git and is a very good &#8216;re-education&#8217; for anyone
coming from an SVN (or similar) background.</p>
<p>In practice, I think you are better off following Joel&#8217;s advice and
understanding git on its own merits instead of trying to bang SVN
concepts into git shapes. But for the occasional translation from SVN to
Git of a specific idiom, the <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.org/course/svn.html">Git - SVN Crash
Course</a> can be handy.</p>

<h4>Better shell support<a class="headerlink" href="#better-shell-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Adding git branch info to your bash prompt and tab completion for git
commands and branches is extremely useful. I suggest you at least copy:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash">git-completion.bash</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh">git-prompt.sh</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can then source both of these files in your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.bashrc</span></code> (Linux) or
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.bash_profile</span></code> (OSX), and then set your prompt (I&#8217;ll assume you
named them as the originals but starting with a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.</span></code> at the front of
the name):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>source $HOME/.git-completion.bash
source $HOME/.git-prompt.sh
PS1=&#39;[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 &quot; (%s)&quot;)]\$ &#39; # adjust this to your prompt liking
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>See the comments in both of those files for lots of extra functionality
they offer.</p>

different, the directory listing would contain this different hash, and so
the hash for the directory listing must be different.</td></tr>

Yes, because the change in the figure would cause a different hash for the
figure; this would cause a different hash for the directory listing, and
this hash in turn appears in the commit contents, causing a different hash
for the commit.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id4">[5]</a></td><td>When git stores a file in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.git/objects</span></code> directory,
it makes a hash from the file, takes the first two digits of the hash to
make a directory name, and then stores a file in this directory with a
filename from the remaining hash digits.  For example, when adding a file
with hash <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">d92d079af6a7f276cc8d63dcf2549c03e7deb553</span></code> git will create
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.git/objects/d9</span></code> directory if it doesn&#8217;t exist, and stores the file
contents as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.git/objects/d9/2d079af6a7f276cc8d63dcf2549c03e7deb553</span></code>.  It
does this so that the number of files in any one directory stay in a
reasonable range.  If git had to store hash filenames for every object in
one flat directory, the directory would soon have a very large number of
files.</td></tr>

any git object, not just a commit.  For example a tag can refer to a tree

always refer to commits.</td></tr>

<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id7">[7]</a></td><td>The reason we need a bare repository for our backup goes
deeper than the fact we do not need a working tree.  We are soon going to
do a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">push</span></code> to this backup repository.  The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">push</span></code> has the effect of
resetting the position of a branch (usually <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>) in the backup repo.
Git is very reluctant to set a branch position in a remote repository with
a working tree, because the new branch position will not not match the
existing content of the working tree.  Git could either leave the remote
working tree out of sync with the new branch position, or update the remote
working tree by doing a checkout of the new branch position, but either
thing would be very confusing for someone trying to use the working tree in
that repository.  So, by default git will refuse to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">push</span></code> a new branch
position to a remote repository with a working tree, giving you a long
explanation as to why it is refusing, and listing things you can do about
it.  You can force git to go ahead and do the push, but it is much safer to
use a bare repository.</td></tr>
