<h2>git - love - hate<a class="headerlink" href="#git-love-hate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve used git now for a long time.  I think it&#8217;s a true masterpiece of design, I
use it all day every day and I just can&#8217;t imagine what it would be like not to
use it. So, no question, I <em>love</em> git.</p>
<p>As y&#8217;all may know, <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git">Linus Torvalds wrote git from scratch</a>.  He loves
it too.  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MShbP3OpASA#t=2288">Here is Linus talking about git</a> in a question and answer
session:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Actually I&#8217;m proud of git. I want to say this. The fact that I had to write
git was accidental, but Linux, the design came from a great mind, and that
great mind was not mine. I mean you have to give credit for the design of
Linux to Kernighan and Ritchie and Thompson. I mean there&#8217;s a reason I like
Unix and I wanted to redo it. I do want to say that git is a design that is
mine and unique, and I&#8217;m proud of the fact that I can damn well also do good
design from scratch.</div></blockquote>
<p>But - some people hate git.  Really <em>hate</em> it. They find it confusing and error
prone and it makes them angry.  Why are there such different views?</p>
<p>I think the reason some people hate git, is because they don&#8217;t yet understand
it.  I reason I can say this without being patronizing is because I went through
something similar myself.</p>
<p>When I first started using git, I found it uncomfortable.  I could see it was
very powerful, but I sometimes got lost and stuck and had to Google for a set of
magic commands to get me out of trouble.  I once accidentally made a huge mess
of our project&#8217;s main repository by running a command I didn&#8217;t understand. Git
often made me feel stupid.  It felt like a prototype racecar with a badly
designed dashboard that was just about to blow an engine or a tire and take me
off the road.</p>
<p>Then, one day, I read the <a class="reference external" href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html">git parable</a>.  The git parable is a little story
about a developer trying to work out how to make a version control system.  It
gradually builds up from copying whole directories of files to something very
much like git.  I didn&#8217;t understand it all right away, but as soon as I read this
page, the light-bulb went on - I got git.  I suddenly started to feel
comfortable.  I knew for sure I could work out why git worked the way it did.  I
could see that it must be possible how to do complicated and powerful things,
and I could work out how to do them.</p>
<p>Reading the git parable took me about 45 minutes, but those 45 minutes changed
me from an unhappy git user to the man you see before you today, someone who
uses git often every day, but, happily, knowing that I have the right tool for
the job.</p>
<p>So, my experience tells me that to use git - yes <em>use</em> git - you need to spend
that 45 minutes to <em>understand</em> git.  You don&#8217;t believe me, or you think that
I&#8217;m a strange kind of person not like you who probably likes writing their own
operating systems. Not so - the insight I&#8217;m describing comes up over and over.
From <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/git">understanding git conceptually</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When I first started using Git, I read plenty of tutorials, as well as the
user manual. Though I picked up the basic usage patterns and commands, I
never felt like I grasped what was going on “under the hood,” so to speak.
Frequently this resulted in cryptic error messages, caused by my random
guessing at the right command to use at a given time. These difficulties
worsened as I began to need more advanced (and less well documented)
features.</p>
<p>When I first started using Git, I read plenty of tutorials, as well as the
user manual. Though I picked up the basic usage patterns and commands, I
never felt like I grasped what was going on “under the hood,” so to speak.
Frequently this resulted in cryptic error messages, caused by my random
guessing at the right command to use at a given time. These difficulties
worsened as I began to need more advanced (and less well documented)
features.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quote from the <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/book">pro git book</a> by Scott Chacon.
The git book is a standard reference that is hosted on the main git website.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Chapter 9: Git Internals</p>
<p>You may have skipped to this chapter from a previous chapter, or you may
have gotten here after reading the rest of the book — in either case, this
is where you’ll go over the inner workings and implementation of Git. I
found that learning this information was fundamentally important to
understanding how useful and powerful Git is, but others have argued to me
that it can be confusing and unnecessarily complex for beginners. Thus, I’ve
made this discussion the last chapter in the book so you could read it early
or later in your learning process. I leave it up to you to decide.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So - have no truck with people who try and tell you that you can just use git
and that you don&#8217;t need the <a class="reference external" href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide">deep shit</a>.  You <em>do</em> need the deep shit, but
the deep shit isn&#8217;t that deep, and it will take you an hour of your time to get
it.  And then I&#8217;m betting that you&#8217;ll see that the alchemist has succeeded at
last, and the shit finally turned into gold.</p>
<p>So - please - invest an hour of your life to understand this stuff.
Concentrate, go slowly, make sure you get it. In return for an hour of your
life, you will get many happy years of use from git, both beautiful, and useful.</p>

<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> is not really a &#8220;Version Control System&#8221;. It is better described
as a &#8220;Content Management System&#8221;, that turns out to be really good for

<p>I&#8217;ll say that again.  Git is a content management system.  Or - to quote from
the <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git.html">root page of the git manual</a>: &#8220;git -
the stupid content tracker&#8221;.</p>

<h2>So git is a content manager - so what?<a class="headerlink" href="#so-git-is-a-content-manager-so-what" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To understand why git does what it does, we first need to think about what a
content manager should do, and why we would want one.</p>
<p>As in the <a class="reference external" href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html">git parable</a> - we&#8217;ll try and design our own, and then see what
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></tt> has to say.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve been working on this paper for a while.</p>
<p>About 2 weeks ago, you were very excited with the results. You ran the script,
made the figure, and went to your advisor, Josephine. She was excited too. The
figure looks good! You get ready to publish in Science.</p>
<p>Today you finished cleaning up for the Science paper, and reran the analysis,
and it doesn&#8217;t look that good anymore. You go to see Josephine. She says &#8220;It

<p>You decide to make your own content management system called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fancy_backups</span></tt>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very simple.</p>
<p>Every time you finish doing some work on your paper, you make a snapshot
of the analysis directory.</p>
<p>The snapshot is just a copy of all the files in the directory, kept
somewhere safe.</p>
<p>You make a directory to store the snapshots called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.fancy_backups</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>nobel_prize
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir .fancy_backups
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then you make a directory for the first backup:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir .fancy_backups/1
<span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir .fancy_backups/1/files
</pre></div>

<p>And you copy the files there:</p>

<h2>Cryptographic hashes<a class="headerlink" href="#cryptographic-hashes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Later on, I&#8217;m going to ask you to solve a very difficult problem.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some background that might help.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to describe &#8220;Crytographic hashes&#8221;. It won&#8217;t be obvious why
that&#8217;s a good idea for a little while.</p>
<p>See : <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">Wikipedia on hash
functions</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>hash</em> is the result of running a <em>hash function</em> over a block of
data. The hash is a fixed length string that is the <em>signature</em> of that
exact block of data. Let&#8217;s run this in Python:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">hashlib</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sha1_hash_function</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">hashlib</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sha1</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;git is a rude word in UK English&quot;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">hash_value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sha1_hash_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hexdigest</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">hash_value</span>
<span class="go">&#39;fec41478c4f497c1d90fd28610f4272c78a6867e&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Not too exciting so far. However, the rather magical nature of this
string is not yet apparent. Here&#8217;s the trick:</p>
<p><strong>There is no practical way for you to find another ``message`` that
will give the same ``hash_value``</strong></p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hash_value</span></tt> then is (nearly) completely unique to that set of
bytes.</p>
<p>For example, a tiny change in the string makes the hash completely
different. Here I&#8217;ve just added a full stop at the end:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So, if you give me some data, and I calculate the hash value, and it
comes out as &#8220;fec41478c4f497c1d90fd28610f4272c78a6867e&#8221;, then I can be
very sure that the data you gave me was exactly the string &#8220;git is a
rude word in UK English&#8221;.</p>

<p>We can specify the order by adding the commit hash of the previous

<p>In the commit above, we used the -m flag to specify a message at the
command line. If we don&#8217;t do that, git will open the editor we specified
in our configuration above and require that we enter a message. By
default, git refuses to record changes that don&#8217;t have a message to go
along with them (though you can obviously &#8216;cheat&#8217; by using an empty or
meaningless string: git only tries to facilitate best practices, it&#8217;s
not your nanny).</p>

<!-- offline:

--><p>There can be multiple branches alive at any point in time; the working
directory is the state of a special pointer called HEAD. In this example
there are two branches, <em>master</em> and <em>testing</em>, and <em>testing</em> is the
currently active branch since it&#8217;s what HEAD points to:</p>

<p>Once new commits are made on a branch, HEAD and the branch label move
with the new commits:</p>

--><p>This allows the history of both branches to diverge:</p>

information to merge the divergent branches back and continue with a
unified line of development:</p>

<p>We are now going to try two different routes of development: on the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></tt> branch we will add one file and on the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">experiment</span></tt> branch,
which we will create, we will add a different one. We will then merge
the experimental branch into <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></tt>.</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>!git branch experiment

</div>
<p>What just happened? We made a branch, which is a pointer to this same

<p>Up until now we have been on the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></tt> branch. When we make a

<p>As we&#8217;ll see later, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span> <span class="pre">somebranch</span></tt> also sets the contents

this case the commits for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">experiment</span></tt> are currently
the same, so we don&#8217;t change the working tree at all.</p>

<div class="section" id="an-important-aside-conflict-management">
<h3>An important aside: conflict management<a class="headerlink" href="#an-important-aside-conflict-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While git is very good at merging, if two different branches modify the
same file in the same location, it simply can&#8217;t decide which change
should prevail. At that point, human intervention is necessary to make
the decision. Git will help you by marking the location in the file that
has a problem, but it&#8217;s up to you to resolve the conflict. Let&#8217;s see how
that works by intentionally creating a conflict.</p>
<p>We start by creating a branch and making a change to our experiment
file:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>!git branch trouble
!git checkout trouble
!echo &quot;This is going to be a problem...&quot; &gt;&gt; experiment.txt
!git add experiment.txt
!git commit -m&quot;Changes in the trouble branch&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Switched to branch &#39;trouble&#39;
[trouble 6921250] Changes in the trouble branch
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And now we go back to the master branch, where we change the <em>same</em>
file:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>!git checkout master
!echo &quot;More work on the master branch...&quot; &gt;&gt; experiment.txt
!git add experiment.txt
!git commit -m&quot;Mainline work&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Switched to branch &#39;master&#39;
[master 1ebca55] Mainline work
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
</pre></div>

<div class="section" id="more-configuration-for-fuller-output">
<h3>More configuration for fuller output<a class="headerlink" href="#more-configuration-for-fuller-output" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This line tells git how to show conflicts in text files.</p>
<p>See <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">config</span> <span class="pre">--help</span></tt> and look for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">merge.conflictstyle</span></tt> for more

<p>This setting asks git to show:</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see what git has put into our file:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>!cat experiment.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Some crazy idea
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
More work on the master branch...
||||||| merged common ancestors
=======
This is going to be a problem...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trouble
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Read this as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Common ancestor (between <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">||</span></tt>... and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">==</span></tt>) has nothing;</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HEAD</span></tt> - the current branch - (between <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;&lt;</span></tt>... and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">||</span></tt>) adds
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">More</span> <span class="pre">work</span> <span class="pre">on</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">master</span> <span class="pre">branch...</span></tt>;</li>
<li>the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trouble</span></tt> branch (between <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">==</span></tt>... and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;</span></tt>...) adds
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">This</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">going</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">be</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">problem...</span></tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, we go into the file with a text editor, decide which
changes to keep, and make a new commit that records our decision.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll do the edits by writing the file I want directly in this case:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>%%file experiment.txt
Some crazy idea
More work on the master branch...
This is going to be a problem...
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Overwriting experiment.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve now made the edits. I decided that both pieces of text were useful,
but integrated them with some changes:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>!git status
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre># On branch master
# You have unmerged paths.
#   (fix conflicts and run &quot;git commit&quot;)
#
# Unmerged paths:
#   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to mark resolution)
#
#   [31mboth modified:      experiment.txt[m
#
no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s then make our new commit:</p>
<div class="code python highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>!git add experiment.txt
!git commit -m &quot;Completed merge of trouble, fixing conflicts along the way&quot;
!git slog
</pre></div>
</div>
<pre class="literal-block">

<p>There are lots of good tutorials and introductions for Git, which you
can easily find yourself; this is just a short list of things I&#8217;ve found
useful. For a beginner, I would recommend the following &#8216;core&#8217; reading
list, and below I mention a few extra resources:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The smallest, and in the style of this tuorial: <a class="reference external" href="http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide">git - the simple
guide</a> contains &#8216;just the
basics&#8217;. Very quick read.</li>
<li>The concise <a class="reference external" href="http://gitref.org">Git Reference</a>: compact but with
all the key ideas. If you only read one document, make it this one.</li>
<li>In my own experience, the most useful resource was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/git">Understanding Git
Conceptually</a>. Git has a
reputation for being hard to use, but I have found that with a clear
view of what is actually a <em>very simple</em> internal design, its
behavior is remarkably consistent, simple and comprehensible.</li>
<li>For more detail, see the start of the excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://progit.org/book">Pro
Git</a> online book, or similarly the early
parts of the <a class="reference external" href="http://book.git-scm.com">Git community book</a>. Pro
Git&#8217;s chapters are very short and well illustrated; the community
book tends to have more detail and has nice screencasts at the end of
some sections.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are really impatient and just want a quick start, this <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ralfebert.de/blog/tools/visual_git_tutorial_1">visual
git
tutorial</a>
may be sufficient. It is nicely illustrated with diagrams that show what
happens on the filesystem.</p>
<p>For windows users, <a class="reference external" href="http://nathanj.github.com/gitguide/tour.html">an Illustrated Guide to Git on
Windows</a> is useful in
that it contains also some information about handling SSH (necessary to
interface with git hosted on remote servers when collaborating) as well
as screenshots of the Windows interface.</p>

<h3>Beyond the basics<a class="headerlink" href="#beyond-the-basics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As you&#8217;ve seen, this tutorial makes the bold assumption that you&#8217;ll be
able to understand how git works by seeing how it is <em>built</em>. These two
documents, written in a similar spirit, are probably the most useful
descriptions of the Git architecture short of diving into the actual
implementation. They walk you through how you would go about building a
version control system with a little story. By the end you realize that
Git&#8217;s model is almost an inevitable outcome of the proposed constraints:</p>

clients to browse a repo and to operate in it. I personally have
found <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qgit/">qgit</a> to be nicer
and easier to use. It is available on modern linux distros, and
since it is based on Qt, it should run on OSX and Windows.</dd>

<h3>For SVN users<a class="headerlink" href="#for-svn-users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you want a bit more background on why the model of version control
used by Git and Mercurial (known as distributed version control) is such
a good idea, I encourage you to read this very well written
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2010/03/17.html">post</a> by Joel
Spolsky on the topic. After that post, Joel created a very nice
Mercurial tutorial, whose <a class="reference external" href="http://hginit.com/00.html">first page</a>
applies equally well to git and is a very good &#8216;re-education&#8217; for anyone
coming from an SVN (or similar) background.</p>
<p>In practice, I think you are better off following Joel&#8217;s advice and
understanding git on its own merits instead of trying to bang SVN
concepts into git shapes. But for the occasional translation from SVN to
Git of a specific idiom, the <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.org/course/svn.html">Git - SVN Crash
Course</a> can be handy.</p>

<p>Adding git branch info to your bash prompt and tab completion for git
commands and branches is extremely useful. I suggest you at least copy:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash">git-completion.bash</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh">git-prompt.sh</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can then source both of these files in your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.bashrc</span></tt> (Linux) or
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.bash_profile</span></tt> (OSX), and then set your prompt (I&#8217;ll assume you
named them as the originals but starting with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.</span></tt> at the front of
the name):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>source :math:`HOME/.git-completion.bash

source `HOME/.git-prompt.sh
