.. _msvcrt-notes:

For a discussion of the generic ``MSVCRT.DLL`` compared to the DLLs specific
to the VC version, see `this blog post
<https://kobyk.wordpress.com/2007/07/20/dynamically-linking-with-msvcrtdll-using-visual-c-2005>`_.
See also `these comments on using MSVCRT.DLL from Mingw-w64
<http://sourceforge.net/p/mingw-w64/wiki2/The%20case%20against%20msvcrt.dll>`_.

For 2015, MS split the C runtime into two component libraries.  See:

* blog post on the `the universal CRT
  <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2015/03/03/introducing-the-universal-crt.aspx>`_
* Steve Dower's first blog post: `Python 3.5 extensions part 1
  <http://stevedower.id.au/blog/building-for-python-3-5>`_;
* Steve's second blog post: `Python 3.5 extensions part 2
  <http://stevedower.id.au/blog/building-for-python-3-5-part-two>`_;

The CRT components are:

* ``ucrtbase.dl``: "The Universal CRT (UCRT) contains the functions and
  globals exported by the standard C99 CRT library. The UCRT is now a Windows
  component, and ships as part of Windows 10." (see `CRT 2015
  <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/abx4dbyh.aspx>`_).
* ``vcruntime140.dll`` : "The vcruntime library contains Visual C++ CRT
  implementation-specific code, such as exception handling and debugging
  support, runtime checks and type information, implementation details and
  certain extended library functions. This library is specific to the version
  of the compiler used." (`CRT 2015`_);

The C++ runtime for VS2015 is ``MSVCP140.dll`` (`CRT 2015`_).

The C++ runtime for VS2017 is also ``MSVCP140.dll``, but, for version 15.6,
there is an additional ``MSVCP140_1.dll``, ABI compatible with ``MSVCP140.dll``, but with additional standard library functionality; see `this MSVC page <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/crt-library-features?view=msvc-160>`_.

and: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9047072/windows-python-version-and-vc-redistributable-version

The version of Visual Studio is described in ``readme.txt`` in the ``PCBuild``
folder of the source distribution.  The full Visual C++ version number is in
either ``release.vsprops`` or ``release.props``.  I read these files from the
`CPython Hg web interface <http://hg.python.org/cpython/tags>`_ for each
tagged release, up to Python 3.6, and thence, from the `CPython Github
repository <https://github.com/python/cpython>`_.

Installing free versions of Microsoft Visual C / C++
****************************************************

Pythons 2.7 (and 3.2)
=====================

If you are compiling for Python 2.7, you should first try the installer at
http://aka.ms/vcpython27.  I installed this for all users from a ``cmd``
Window opened with "run as administrator", like this::

    msiexec /i VCForPython27.msi ALLUSERS=1

This command line comes from the "Install instructions" on the download page.
For me, the installer runs but closes without showing any signs that it has
finished.  The compilers seem to work fine nevertheless.  If this standalone
Python 2.7 compiler set works for you, you should be able to compile both 32
and 64 bit extensions without further configuration.  If not, see
:ref:`other-options`.

Pythons 3.3 and 3.4
===================

For Pythons 3.3 and 3.4 you will need MSVC 2010.

Compiling for 64-bit
++++++++++++++++++++

For 64-bit compiles, I recommend you get your compilers via the Window 7.1 SDK.
This includes the VS 10 / 2010 command line compilers you need to compile
Python extensions.  I found that I needed to install from the `offline ISO
files <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8442>`_.  As
you will see in the "Install Instructions", choose ``GRMSDKX_EN_DVD.iso`` for
64-bit compiles.

I believe Windows 8, 10 and server 2012 can mount ISO files from explorer.  For
Windows 7 / server 2008 I used `Virtual clone drive
<http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html>`_ to mount the ISO files.

To run the install, navigate to the folder ``Setup`` on the DVD image, and run
``SDKSetup.exe``.  Otherwise you may get an error about .NET components that
cannot be installed.

Finally, for 64-bits, I needed to apply this patch to avoid a distutils
compilation error ending in ``ValueError: ['path']``::

  echo "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.cmd" /x64 > "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin\amd64/vcvars64.bat"

See `this MSVC 2010 SO post
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32091593/cannot-install-windows-sdk-7-1-on-windows-10>`_
for details on installing the Windows 7.1 SDK, and `this SO answer
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26473854/python-pip-has-issues-with-path-for-ms-visual-studio-2010-express-for-64-bit-ins>`_
for specifics on the 64-bit distutils error that can be fixed with the
``echo`` command above.

Compiling for 32-bit
++++++++++++++++++++

Download and install the `MSVC 2010 express edition
<https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/profile/review?download=true&family=VisualStudioCExpress&release=VisualStudio2010>`_.

Python 3.5, 3.6
===============

For Python 3.5 and 3.6 32-bit and 64-bit extensions you need MSVC 14 / 2015.
Your fastest route to success will likely be the `MSVC 2015 command line tools
<http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools>`_.  Install these
first.  To get Python to recognize the MSVC command line tools, you will need
a version of the `setuptools package
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ >= 24.0.  Check by::

    python -c 'import setuptools; print(setuptools.__version__)'

If your version is < 24.0, then::

    pip install --upgrade setuptools

See the `Python Windows compilers wiki page
<https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers>`_ for more details.

Another option is to install the whole `VS 2015 community edition
<https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs>`_.   It's a
huge 11GB install which took more than an hour on my machine.  Do a custom
install, and select the VC++ compiler component (it is not selected by
default).

***********************************
Other options for MSVC installation
***********************************

If the VS for Python 2.7 installer doesn't work for you, or you can't get VS
2010 compilation working for 3.3 / 3.4, see the links below.

In overview, you may be able to find the free Visual Studio express download
that you need on the Microsoft site, but until VS 2015, these do not compile
64-bit extensions by default.   The instructions above give the easiest way to
get 64-bit compiles working, but you can also try the other methods given in
the links below.
